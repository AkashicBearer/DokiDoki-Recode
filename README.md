# DokiDoki-Recode Official Recode
Official github page for the new DokiDoki Discord bot recoded into Discord.JS v14 from v12 (or even 10) from whatever it was before. 

## Project status
Slow progress due to day to day issues at work and much more.

## Information to know
All updates from now on will be happening in this github rep, meaning that [DokiDoki](https://github.com/AkashicBearer/DokiDoki) will be archived and made private until further notice. 
  
I'd also like to inform you that this recode will take me a while to do due to my daily life and help is welcome.

## Some Back Story

DokiDoki started out back in early 2018 as a school project I had in mind, after a while thanks to the help of some people I met over time, the bot grew to what it was back in 2020 before the COVID Pandemic, after that due to my University being Online, I had to focus a bit more than usual, especially with my licensing and exams coming soon. 

Fastforward to 2022 and although the bot is now basically broken due to all the updates discord has released and me not being able to do maintenance on the bot. 

Although many of the old commands will either not come back or not come for a while, I hope those of you who are still using DokiDoki to keep doing so even after the recode.
